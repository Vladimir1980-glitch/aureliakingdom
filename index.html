            <p id="about-text">Aurelian Kingdom, "The Golden Kingdom," was founded more than a thousand years ago by the great King Evandor I, who led his people across the Solaris Mountains to fertile lands filled with golden rivers and radiant forests. At the heart of the kingdom, the capital city of Solaris was built — the City of Light, where a ruler sat upon a throne of pure gold, safeguarding the peace and prosperity of Aurelia.</p>
            <p id="legend-text">According to legend, the sun god Auris blessed this land, promising that its people would live in harmony with nature, but only as long as they maintained its balance and order.</p>
